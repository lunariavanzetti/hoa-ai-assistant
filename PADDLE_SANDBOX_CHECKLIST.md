# 🔧 Paddle Sandbox Configuration Checklist

## ❌ **Current Issue: 400 Error**
Your integration is working perfectly, but Paddle is returning a 400 error. This means there's a configuration problem in your Paddle sandbox dashboard.

## 📋 **Paddle Dashboard Verification Steps:**

### **Step 1: Check Price Status**
1. Go to **Paddle Sandbox Dashboard** → **Catalog** → **Prices**
2. Find price: `pri_01k1jvam7jgeg2sjxwf6xkn8dj`

### **Step 2: Verify Product Linking**
1. Click on the price `pri_01k1jvam7jgeg2sjxwf6xkn8dj`
2. **Check "Linked Product"**: Should show a product name
3. **If No Product**: Create and link a product
4. **Product Requirements**:
   - Name: "Kateriss Pro Plan" (or similar)
   - Description: Required
   - Category: Software/SaaS

## 🎯 **Most Likely Fix:**

### **Price Status Issue (90% probability):**
Your prices might be in "Draft" status. To fix:

1. **Go to**: Paddle Dashboard → Catalog → Prices
2. **Find**: `pri_01k1jvam7jgeg2sjxwf6xkn8dj` (Pro Monthly)
3. **Check Status**: If it says "Draft"
4. **Action**: Click "Activate" or "Publish"
5. **Repeat**: For all 6 prices

### **Product Linking Issue (10% probability):**
If prices are active but not linked to products:

1. **Create Product**: Catalog → Products → New Product
2. **Name**: "Kateriss Pro Plan"
3. **Description**: "Professional HOA management software"
4. **Category**: "Software"
5. **Link Price**: Go back to price and link to this product

---

## 🧪 **Testing After Fix:**

1. **Activate all 6 prices** in Paddle dashboard
2. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for changes to propagate
3. **Test checkout** again at https://hoa-ai-assistant.vercel.app/pricing
4. **Expected Result**: Paddle checkout form appears instead of 400 error

---

## 📞 **If Still Not Working:**

### **Verify These in Paddle Dashboard:**
- [ ] All 6 prices show "Active" status
- [ ] Each price is linked to a product
- [ ] Products have descriptions and tax categories
- [ ] Sandbox client token matches environment

### **Alternative Test:**
Try creating a **brand new price** in Paddle sandbox:
1. Create new product: "Test Product"
2. Create new price: $1.00 monthly
3. Make sure it's Active
4. Test with this new price ID

**🎯 Next Step**: Check your Paddle sandbox dashboard for price status - they're probably in Draft mode and need to be activated!
