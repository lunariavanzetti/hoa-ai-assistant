  2. üî• Reddit Strategy - Detailed Answers

  What to Post Instead of [Share actual template]:

  **Post Example:**
  Title: "I automated my HOA violation letters and saved 15 hours/week - here's the free template"

  Body:
  "As an HOA board member, I was spending 3+ hours writing each violation letter. Here's the template I perfected over 2 years:

  **VIOLATION LETTER TEMPLATE:**
  [Property Address]
  [Date]

  Dear [Resident Name],

  RE: Community Guidelines Violation - [Violation Type]

  This letter serves as formal notification that a violation of community guidelines has been observed at your property on [Date].

  **Violation Details:**
  - Type: [Specific violation]
  - Location: [Specific area]
  - CC&R Section: [Reference]

  **Required Action:**
  [Specific steps to resolve]

  **Timeline:**
  Please remedy this violation within [timeframe] days of receipt of this letter.

  For questions, contact us at [contact info].

  Sincerely,
  [Manager Name]
  [Title]

  **The twist:** I got so tired of writing these manually that I built an AI tool that generates them automatically. Still working on it, but this
  template has saved me countless hours in the meantime.

  What other HOA templates do you need? I might have them!"

  Reddit Rules - How to Not Get Banned:

  ‚úÖ SAFE Methods:
  - Share actual value first (the template)
  - Mention your tool as a side note ("I built something")
  - Don't include direct links in the original post
  - Wait for people to ask for the tool in comments
  - Then share via DM or subtle mention

  ‚ùå BANNED Methods:
  - Direct promotional posts
  - Links in original post
  - "Check out my website"
  - Immediate sales pitch

  Can You Create Your Own Community?

  YES! Create r/HOAManagement or r/HOAAutomation
  - Post daily value content
  - Cross-promote in larger subreddits
  - Build authority in your niche
  - Less competition, full control

  Hi [Name],

  I noticed your comment on [specific post about HOA/property management]. As someone in the industry, I thought you'd find value in this free HOA
  violation letter template I created - it's saved property managers 10+ hours per week.

  Would you like me to send it over? No strings attached - just trying to help fellow professionals.

  Best,
  [Your name]

  P.S. The template includes legal compliance guidelines that most people miss.

  Follow-up after they respond:
  Send the template + mention: "I also built a tool that automates this process if you ever want to check it out: [your website]"

  6. üõ† Automated Response Tools

  Best Tools for Social Media Automation:

  Option 1: Buffer + Cursor (Recommended)
  - Buffer schedules posts across platforms
  - Use Cursor to generate responses on-demand
  - Semi-automated but high quality

  Option 2: Hootsuite + Custom AI
  - More expensive but more features
  - Built-in analytics and monitoring

  Option 3: Custom Solution
  - Use Zapier to monitor mentions
  - Trigger Claude API to generate responses
  - Most customizable but requires setup

  7. üîç HOA AI Competitor Research

  Popular HOA AI Tools:

  1. AppFolio Property Manager
  - Not AI-focused, traditional property management
  - Viral through: Sales team, trade shows, referrals
  - Weakness: Not HOA-specific, expensive

  2. Buildium
  - Property management with some automation
  - Viral through: Google ads, content marketing
  - Weakness: Complex, not AI-powered

  3. HOA Management Solutions (smaller players)
  - Most are traditional software, not AI
  - Opportunity: You're first-to-market with AI focus

  Why They're Viral:

  - Content marketing: Educational blog posts
  - Free trials: Low barrier to entry
  - Partnerships: With property management companies
  - Trade shows: Industry networking

  Your Competitive Advantage:

  - AI-first approach (others are catching up)
  - HOA-specific (not general property management)
  - Modern UX (most competitors look outdated)
  - Affordable pricing (theirs start at $50-200/month)

  9. üìù "Free Templates" Explanation

  Current Status: WE DON'T HAVE TEMPLATES YET

  What You Need to Create:

  1. Downloadable PDF Templates:
  - HOA Violation Letter Template
  - Complaint Response Template
  - Meeting Minutes Template
  - Board Resolution Template
  - Architectural Request Form

  2. Where to Add Them:
  - Create /templates page on your website
  - Add download forms (email required)
  - Include in onboarding flow
  - Use as lead magnets

  3. Implementation Steps:

‚è∫ Write(src/pages/Templates.tsx)
  ‚éø  Wrote 169 lines to src/pages/Templates.tsx                                    
     import React, { useState } from 'react'
     import { motion } from 'framer-motion'
     import { Download, FileText, Mail, Calendar, Building } from 'lucide-react'
     export const Templates: React.FC = () => {
       const [email, setEmail] = useState('')
       const [downloadedTemplates, setDownloadedTemplates] = useState<string[]>([])
       const templates = [
         {
     ‚Ä¶ +159 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Perfect! Now I've created a templates page. I need to add it to the router so it's accessible. Let me update the App.tsx to include the Templates route.

‚è∫ Update(src/App.tsx)
  ‚éø  Updated src/App.tsx with 1 addition                            
       18    import { TermsOfService } from '@/pages/TermsOfService'
       19    import { PrivacyPolicy } from '@/pages/PrivacyPolicy'
       20    import { RefundPolicy } from '@/pages/RefundPolicy'
       21 +  import { Templates } from '@/pages/Templates'
       22    import { Landing } from '@/pages/Landing'
       23    import { Auth } from '@/pages/Auth'
       24    import { AuthCallback } from '@/pages/AuthCallback'

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Now I need to add the Templates route to both the authenticated and unauthenticated sections.

‚è∫ Update(src/App.tsx)
  ‚éø  Updated src/App.tsx with 1 addition                                                      
       42                      <Route path="/terms-of-service" element={<TermsOfService />} />
       43                      <Route path="/privacy-policy" element={<PrivacyPolicy />} />
       44                      <Route path="/refund-policy" element={<RefundPolicy />} />
       45 +                    <Route path="/templates" element={<Templates />} />
       46                      <Route path="*" element={<Landing />} />
       47                    </>
       48                  ) : (

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  I should also add it to the authenticated section so logged-in users can access it too.

‚è∫ Update(src/App.tsx)
  ‚éø  Updated src/App.tsx with 1 addition                                                     
       62                      <Route path="terms-of-service" element={<TermsOfService />} />
       63                      <Route path="privacy-policy" element={<PrivacyPolicy />} />
       64                      <Route path="refund-policy" element={<RefundPolicy />} />
       65 +                    <Route path="templates" element={<Templates />} />
       66                      <Route path="auth/callback" element={<AuthCallback />} />
       67                    </Route>
       68                  )}

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Now I should also add a link to the templates page from the landing page footer.

‚è∫ Update(src/pages/Landing.tsx)
  ‚éø  Error editing file

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Let me read the Landing page file first.

‚è∫ Read(src/pages/Landing.tsx)
  ‚éø  Read 20 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  Perfect, now I can edit to add the templates link.

‚è∫ Update(src/pages/Landing.tsx)
  ‚éø  Updated src/pages/Landing.tsx with 1 addition
