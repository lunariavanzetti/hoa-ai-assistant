### Auto CC&R Section Mapping

```typescript
const ccrSections = {

  'Parking Violations': 'Section 6.1 - Vehicle Parking and Storage',
  'Architectural Changes': 'Section 5.3 - Architectural Review Committee Approval',
  'Noise Complaints': 'Section 7.4 - Noise and Nuisance Restrictions',

}
```

### Progressive Enforcement Logic

1. **First Violation (0 previous)**:
   - Educational approach
   - Standard compliance timeline
   - Offers assistance and clarification

2. **Second Violation (1 previous)**:
   - Warning tone with fine threat
   - $50/day monetary penalty mentioned
   - Shorter compliance timeline

3. **Multiple Violations (2+ previous)**:
   - Immediate compliance required
   - Legal action warnings
   - Accelerated enforcement process
   - Potential property liens mentioned
